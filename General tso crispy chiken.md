About 500 grams of chicken, cut into small pieces.

30 grams of minced ginger.

10 cloves of garlic, finely chopped

1/2 red pepper, finely chopped

1 carrot, finely chopped

Potato starch (you may use cornstarch, but the finish will be much less crispy)

1 whole egg

Sauce:

About 100 ml of soy sauce

Two teaspoons of honey

About 150 ml of water

Tablespoon of sugar,

Hot sauce to your taste

1 tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a small quantity of water in a small cup.
Put the chicken in a bowl, add a table spoon of soy sauce, salt, pepper, a pinch of ginger and garlic and let in marinate in the fridge for an hour at least.
For the sauce, add all the elements above in a bowl, stir and taste. Rectify the portions if needed. Keep the corn starch mixture aside and set the sauce aside as well.
After an hour, take the chicken out of the fridge and let it rest to room temp for 30 more minutes. Put the chicken in a large bowl, add the egg. Stir well. Add the potato starch. Stir with your hand and make sure it covers all the pieces of chicken very well. (Before adding the starch, season it with salt, pepper and garlic powder before mixing with the chicken!). Set the mixture aside.
In a large pan or wok (ideally), fry the chicken pieces in small batches for 1.5 to 2 minutes each. Fry each batch a second time for about 30 seconds for an extra crisp. That's an important stage. For this operation I used sunflower oil. Once the chicken pieces are fried, set aside.
Then, in a large pan or wok, stir fry the garlic, the pepper and the ginger all together for about 30 seconds on very high temp. Add the sauce mix. Stir and let it cook for about a 1 minute. Add the starch/water mix and stir well. This will allow the sauce to thicken. Let is reduce until it thickens well. Add the chicken pieces, stir well and serve immediately. You can add spring onions on the top if you like it.
